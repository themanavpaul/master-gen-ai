## Hey Generative AI Enthusiasts! 

I'm [Manav Paul](https://linktr.ee/themanavpaul), a 24-year-old spiritual developer on a mission to demystify generative AI. Fascinated by its potential, I'm embarking on a 30-day journey to master this cutting-edge technology. This repository is my digital travelogue, where I'll share insights, experiments, and code as I unravel the secrets of generative AI.

Whether you're a curious beginner or a seasoned developer, this journey is designed to be accessible and engaging. Dive into the wonders of generative AI and discover how it can be used to:

* Summarize lengthy articles (check out my AI Article Summarizer: [https://chaturai.netlify.app/](https://chaturai.netlify.app/))
* Create a 24/7 AI twin that assists you even while you sleep (learn more about my AI Twin 24/7: [https://manavpaul.hashnode.dev/my-ai-twin-works-247-even-while-i-sleep](https://manavpaul.hashnode.dev/my-ai-twin-works-247-even-while-i-sleep))
* And much more!
